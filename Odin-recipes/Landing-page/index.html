                        We've been working on this project of settlement on the moon for a long time. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our team, we're finally ready to receive the first colonists.

                        Our installation is located in the center of the moon, in a place called the Lunar Base. It's a perfect place for us to start our journey to the first colony. We're excited to be here!

                        We expect to be able to receive the first colonists in the next few months. We're working hard to make sure that everything is ready for them to start their journey. You can choose an private ship.

                        This is the place where we'll be living and working. We're planning to build a small village here, where the colonists will live and work. We're also planning to have a marketplace.

                I'm totally stoked to be a part of this project. Humans have always been fascinated by the moon and the possibility of life on it. This is a step towards the full colonization of the solar system.
